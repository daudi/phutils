##' @param keep.sheets A vector of sheet names to keep. This only works on windows (but presumably 
##' libreoffice code could be added). All sheets are converted, and if keep.sheets is NULL (the default) 
##' then all sheets will be returned. If keep.sheets 
##' is not NULL then only those named in keep.sheets are kept.
